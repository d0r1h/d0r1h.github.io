Thank you for visiting my website!

I am currently a graduate student working towards my Master of Technology (M.Tech) degree in Data Science and Machine Learning at [PES University](https://pes.edu/). I have earned my Bachelor's degree in Information technology from [SRM University](https://www.srmist.edu.in) in 2019. I am currently based in Bengaluru, India. 

During undergraduate I wokred on **Enhancing cloud security for access confidentiality by server swapping** as my final year projects under guidance of [Ms. G. Sujatha](https://www.srmist.edu.in/department-of-networking-and-communications/faculty/g-sujatha). 
I have worked with [DR. Shila Gite](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=VKolPrMAAAAJ&hl=en) at [SCAAI](https://scaai.edu.in/) as a Research collaborator Intern on project **Summarization of Legal Documents**.


Currently, I'm [AWS community Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/community-builders-directory/?cb-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.cbName&cb-cards.sort-order=asc&awsf.builder-category=cb-type%23ai-ml&awsf.location=location%23apac&awsf.year=year%232021&awsm.page-cb-cards=2) in Machine Learning 2021 Fall cohort. I participate in competitions on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/undersc0re) and share my learning experience at [medium](d0r1h.medium.com).


I have worked with data analysis tools such as Pandas, SQL, and Hive and for my NLP work I've used Huggingface ecosystem to train big langauge models and for computer vision tasks I've utilized Keras/TensorFlow, and Weights and Biases for tracking machine learning experiments, for tabular data I've used scikit-learn. 

You can access models and datasets developed by me at [ðŸ¤—](https://huggingface.co/d0r1h) hub.
