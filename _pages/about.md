 Data Scientist with 3 years of experience in retail analytics, specializing in machine learning and NLP to drive scalable, data-driven business solutions. Skilled in SQL, PySpark, Python (Pandas), and PyTorch, with hands-on experience in designing, deploying, and optimizing ML models for large-scale data processing and decision support.

 My research background in NLP, includes project on legal domain document summarization at [SCAAI](https://scaai.edu.in/) with guidence of [DR. Shila Gite](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=VKolPrMAAAAJ&hl=en) and co-authored paper titled :  [Indian Legal Corpus (ILC): A Dataset for A Dataset Summarizing Indian Legal Proceeding Using Natural Language](https://www.espublisher.com/journals/articledetails/1022).

I graduated with  Master of Technology (M.Tech) degree in Data Science and Machine Learning at [PES University](https://pes.edu/) in 2022. I have earned my Bachelor's degree in Information technology from [SRM University](https://www.srmist.edu.in) in 2019. I am currently based in Bengaluru, India. 

During undergraduate I wokred on **Enhancing cloud security for access confidentiality by server swapping** as my final year projects under guidance of [Ms. G. Sujatha](https://www.srmist.edu.in/department-of-networking-and-communications/faculty/g-sujatha).


 I continuously contribute to the ML community through open-source models on Hugging Face, Kaggle competitions, and technical blogs.

I was [AWS community Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/community-builders-directory/?cb-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.cbName&cb-cards.sort-order=asc&awsf.builder-category=cb-type%23ai-ml&awsf.location=location%23apac&awsf.year=year%232021&awsm.page-cb-cards=2) in Machine Learning 2021 Fall cohort. I participate in competitions on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/undersc0re) and share my learning experience at [medium](d0r1h.medium.com).


I have worked with data analysis tools such as Pandas, SQL, and Hive and for my NLP and Computer Vision work I've used Pytorch, Huggingface ecosystem to train big langauge models, and Weights and Biases for tracking machine learning experiments, for tabular data I've used scikit-learn. 

I've also worked on the RAG, LangChain to build applications. 

You can access models and datasets developed by me at [ðŸ¤—](https://huggingface.co/d0r1h) hub.
