 Data Scientist with 3 years of experience in retail analytics, specializing in machine learning and NLP to drive scalable, data-driven business solutions. Skilled in SQL, PySpark, Python (Pandas), and PyTorch, with hands-on experience in designing, deploying, and optimizing ML models for large-scale data processing and decision support.

 My research background in NLP includes a project on the legal domain, summarization of long documents at [SCAAI](https://scaai.edu.in/) under the guidance of [Dr. Shila Gite](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=VKolPrMAAAAJ&hl=en). I authored a paper titled: [Indian Legal Corpus (ILC): A Dataset for Summarizing Indian Legal Proceedings Using Natural Language](https://www.espublisher.com/journals/articledetails/1022).

I graduated with a Master of Technology (M.Tech) degree in Data Science and Machine Learning from [PES University](https://pes.edu/) in 2022. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from [SRM University](https://www.srmist.edu.in) in 2019. I am currently based in Bengaluru, India. 

During my undergraduate studies, I worked on **Enhancing cloud security for access confidentiality by server swapping** as my final year project under the guidance of [Ms. G. Sujatha](https://www.srmist.edu.in/department-of-networking-and-communications/faculty/g-sujatha).


 I continuously contribute to the ML community through open-source models on Hugging Face, Kaggle competitions, and technical blogs.

I was an [AWS Community Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/community-builders-directory/?cb-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.cbName&cb-cards.sort-order=asc&awsf.builder-category=cb-type%23ai-ml&awsf.location=location%23apac&awsf.year=year%232021&awsm.page-cb-cards=2) in Machine Learning for the 2021 Fall cohort. I participate in competitions on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/undersc0re) and share my learning experiences on [Medium](https://d0r1h.medium.com).


I have worked with data analysis tools such as Pandas, SQL, and Hive. For my NLP and Computer Vision work, I've used PyTorch, the Hugging Face ecosystem to train large language models, and Weights and Biases for tracking machine learning experiments. For tabular data, I've used scikit-learn. 

I've also worked with RAG and LangChain to build applications. 

You can access models and datasets developed by me at the [🤗 Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/d0r1h) hub.
