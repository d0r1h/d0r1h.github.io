This is the privacy practice(PP) guide for your online activities…

In the [first part](https://medium.com/@d0r1h/my-journey-to-stay-safe-anonymous-in-the-digital-age-v-1-6732c9ff5b13) of this series, I talked about Privacy/Security general, kind of both on Mobile as well as Computer machines to give you kind of overview and listed few tools to help you(in getting start).

But from this series, I’ll be specific about the technology that I am talking about i.e mobile devices, Computer machines, or your online activities.

There can be very different kinds of arguments when it comes to online privacy/safety and here is mine. For that take this example — “You are a kind of person who isn’t very open about their sexual orientation to anyone but you can go online, do what you need, watch what you want.. and these activities can reflect in your ads that are popping in your mail or website ( How! — advertising agencies creates your profile based on your online activity and serve you ads based on that) but no one will ever know about your online activity if you follow PP.” 

And the question that comes every time in mind is Why one should care/worry about their online activities. And the answer is that it can lead to many terrible incidents i.e email hacking, identity theft, virus, credit card fraud and many more this is possible because of —

1. Your weak password management ( i.e. using the same password on different website) and having single-factor authentication(SFA)
2. Your bad online surfing habits.
3. Using public wi-fi ( of course, you can use but with some measures )
