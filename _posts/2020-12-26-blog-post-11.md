Babylon is a healthcare startup that uses AI that has been designed around a doctor’s brain to provide accessible healthcare for millions in the palm of their hands.

A large number of Babylon’s products leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence, and there wasn’t enough computing power in-house to run a particular experiment. So Babylon had migrated its user-facing applications to a Kubernetes platform and the infrastructure team turned to Kubeflow, a toolkit for machine learning on Kubernetes. Instead of waiting hours or days to be able to compute, teams can get access instantaneously. Clinical validations used to take 10 hours; now they are done in under 20 minutes. Researchers used to have to wait up to 10 hours to get results on new versions of their models. With Kubernetes, that time is now down to under 20 minutes. Plus, previously they could only run one clinical validation at a time, now they can run many parallel ones if they need to — a huge benefit.
