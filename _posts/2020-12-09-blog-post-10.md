Setting up Reverse Proxy and Load Balance with Haproxy using Ansible.

A reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of web servers and forwards client (e.g. web browser) requests to web servers.

A reverse proxy operates by:

* Receiving a user connection request
* Completing a TCP three-way handshake, terminating the initial connection
* Connecting with the origin server and forwarding the original request

Some of the benefits of a reverse proxy :

* **Load Balancing** : A popular website that gets millions of users every day may not be able to handle all of its incoming site traffic with a single origin server. Instead, the site can be distributed among a pool of different servers, all handling requests for the same site. In this case, a reverse proxy can provide a load balancing solution which will distribute the incoming traffic evenly among the different servers to prevent any single server from becoming overloaded.
* **Protection from attacks** : With a reverse proxy in place, a web site or service never needs to reveal the IP address of their origin server(s). This makes it much harder for attackers to leverage a targeted attack against them. [read more](https://medium.com/@d0r1h/reverse-proxy-haproxy-with-ansible-962d83da1b09)
